                <h1>Welcome to My Planner</h1>
                <p>
                    Keep your schedule, family plans, and to-dos in one simple place so you can
                    focus on what matters most instead of trying to remember everything.

            <h2 class="section-title">Why Use My Planner?</h2>

            <section class="halves">
                <div id="PocketWatch" class="half1"></div>
                <div class="half2">
                    <h3>Take Control of Your Time</h3>
                    <p>
                        Turn your busy days into a clear, simple plan. Use My Planner to block out
                        time for classes, work, workouts, and rest so everything has a place. When
                        you can see your day at a glance, it's easier to say “yes” to the right
                        things and “no” to the distractions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sync Plans With Your Family</h3>
                    <p>
                        No more guessing who is doing what and when. Share plans with your family
                        so everyone knows about appointments, activities, and important events.
                        When schedules are visible to everyone, it's easier to coordinate rides,
                        chores, and quality time together.

                    <h3>Plan Months in Advance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Look ahead to big deadlines, trips, and goals without losing track of
                        today. My Planner helps you map out busy weeks, semesters, or seasons so
                        you're prepared instead of rushed. With a clear long-term view, you can
                        spread out your workload and protect time for the things that matter.
